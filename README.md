## NLP project

# Introduction
This notebook was created for the purpose of experimenting with natural language processing libraries and other tools, following tutorials online.

In this file, I go through various aspects of NLP, including:

* applying OCR tool to extract text from an image
* introducing stopwords and removing them from further research
* processing the dataset by cleaning text from punctuation marks, numbers and other symbols
* practicing tokenization and finding root words (stemming & lemmatization)
* counting frequency of words in a dataset
* getting familiar with a concept of Bag of Words
* visualising the text data using a word cloud (tweet analysis) in two shapes
